# Stress Predictor Classification Project

![Stress](https://github.com/shahriar-math1364/data-science-/blob/main/Project2/stress.jpg)

## Project Overview
This classification project aims to identify the leading predictors of stress in individuals. Stress is a common issue in today's fast-paced world, and understanding the factors that contribute to it can help individuals and organizations mitigate its effects. The project's primary goal is to build a predictive model that can classify whether an individual is likely to experience stress based on various features and variables.
