## Projects

### Used Car Price Prediction



This repository hosts a machine learning model focused on predicting used car prices based on a variety of factors, such as car make, mileage, age, and location.

#### Key Highlights

- The dataset consists of over 10,000 records of used cars with attributes like `make`, `model`, `mileage`, `location`, and their corresponding `price`.
- Explored data, conducted preprocessing, and performed feature engineering to optimize the input for machine learning models.
- Utilized regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Accomplished a significant R^2 score, showcasing the model's accuracy in predicting used car prices.

### Sleep-Stress Classification Project

This repository contains a data-driven project that analyzes and predicts stress levels based on various factors like sleep patterns, occupation, physical activity, and more.
#### Key Highlights

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering performed on `Sleep.csv`, a dataset with numerous variables including occupation, gender, heart rate, etc.
- Employed various classification models: Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost.
- Applied `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning on the XGBoost model, achieving an accuracy of approximately 97%.
- Model artifacts, including the best-performing model and relevant features, are saved for future deployment.
