## Projects

### Used Car Price Prediction



This repository contains a data-driven project that analyzes and predicts stress levels based on various factors like sleep patterns, occupation, physical activity, and more.

#### Key Highlights

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering performed on `Sleep.csv`, a dataset with numerous variables including occupation, gender, heart rate, etc.
- Employed various classification models: Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost.
- Applied `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning on the XGBoost model, achieving an accuracy of approximately 97%.
- Model artifacts, including the best-performing model and relevant features, are saved for future deployment.
