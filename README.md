### Women Celebrity Image Classifier

An image classification project that identifies and classifies images of Katy Perry, Rihanna, Lady Gaga, and BeyoncÃ© using non-deep learning methods.

#### Overview

- **Purpose**: The aim is to showcase an alternative to deep learning-based image classification by employing traditional machine learning techniques.
- **Facial Detection**: Utilizes **OpenCV** for facial image processing and isolation.
- **Feature Extraction**: Implements **Wavelet Transform** to extract features from images.
- **Model Selection**: Multiple machine learning models were trained. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** turned out to be the most accurate and is therefore the model of choice for this project.
- **Fine-tuning**: Used **GridSearchCV** to refine the model parameters and achieve optimal classification accuracy.

#### Key Features

- **Accurate Classification**: Achieved notable accuracy in distinguishing between the celebrities using the **SVM** model.
- **Model Export**: The trained model is exported for further deployment using `pickle`.

### Tomato Image Classification Project

#### Overview

This project is centered around the **multiclass classification** of tomato diseases using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. It is designed to classify tomatoes into the following classes: `Bacterial Spot`, `Early Blight`, `Late Blight`, and `Healthy`.
- Loading and processing tomato images from a **Google Drive directory**.
- Applying **data augmentation techniques** like random flips and rotations for better generalization.
- Constructing a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** libraries for image classification.
- Training the model, evaluating its performance, and visualizing the classification results.

#### Key Features

- **Image Loading**: Efficiently loads and labels images using TensorFlow's capabilities.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhances training data variety through random transformations.
- **CNN Architecture**: Multi-layered CNN architecture for intricate feature extraction from images.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance assessed on a test dataset, with visual comparisons between model predictions and actual labels.
- **Model Export**: The trained model is saved as `tomatoes.h5` for potential deployment and further use.
