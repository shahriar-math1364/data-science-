-**Project Page**: For in-depth details, architecture, and more, [visit our dedicated project page](https://github.com/shahriar-math1364/data-science-/tree/main/Project1).
- **Objective**: Our aim with this project was to harness the power of machine learning to accurately estimate the resale value of used cars.
  
- **Data**: The dataset contains a comprehensive list of features that influence a car's resale value. This includes attributes such as `make`, `model`, `year`, `mileage`, `color`, among others.
  
- **Modeling**: We settled on the `RandomForestRegressor` from scikit-learn for its accuracy and robustness. Our model went through rigorous preprocessing, feature engineering, and fine-tuning stages to ensure optimal performance.
  
- **Performance**: We're proud to announce that our model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of [YOUR_VALUE_HERE]. This metric emphasizes our model's capability in delivering reliable and accurate used car price estimates.
  
- **Deployment**: To make our solution accessible to users, we've rolled out a user-friendly web application. Here, users can obtain real-time price predictions by inputting relevant car details.  Experience our prediction system in action! [Check out the live demo here](YOUR_LIVE_DEMO_LINK).


### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
