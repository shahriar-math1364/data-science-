## Project 1: Used Car Price Prediction

Description: This project involves building predictive models using the Scikit-Learn library. I've worked on a classification problem to predict customer churn for a telecom company. The project covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

## Project 3: Women Singers Image Recognition

Description: This project focuses on natural language processing (NLP) using the NLTK library in Python. I've built a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The project includes text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.
