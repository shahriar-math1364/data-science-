## Projects

### Used Car Price Prediction



This repository hosts a machine learning model focused on predicting used car prices based on a variety of factors, such as car make, mileage, age, and location.

#### Key Highlights

- The dataset consists of over 10,000 records of used cars with attributes like `make`, `model`, `mileage`, `location`, and their corresponding `price`.
- Explored data, conducted preprocessing, and performed feature engineering to optimize the input for machine learning models.
- Utilized regression algorithms such as **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Gradient Boosting**.
- Accomplished a significant R^2 score, showcasing the model's accuracy in predicting used car prices.

### Sleep-Stress Classification Project

This repository contains a data-driven project that analyzes and predicts stress levels based on various factors like sleep patterns, occupation, physical activity, and more.
#### Key Highlights

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering performed on `Sleep.csv`, a dataset with numerous variables including occupation, gender, heart rate, etc.
- Employed various classification models: **Support Vector Machine**, **Logistic Regression**, and **XGBoost**.
- Applied **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning on the XGBoost model, achieving an accuracy of approximately 97%.
- Model artifacts, including the best-performing model and relevant features, are saved for future deployment.

### Women Celebrity Image Classifier

An image classification project that identifies and classifies images of Katy Perry, Rihanna, Lady Gaga, and BeyoncÃ© using non-deep learning methods.

#### Overview

- **Purpose**: The aim is to showcase an alternative to deep learning-based image classification by employing traditional machine learning techniques.
- **Facial Detection**: Utilizes **OpenCV** for facial image processing and isolation.
- **Feature Extraction**: Implements **Wavelet Transform** to extract features from images.
- **Model Selection**: Multiple machine learning models were trained. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** turned out to be the most accurate and is therefore the model of choice for this project.
- **Fine-tuning**: Used **GridSearchCV** to refine the model parameters and achieve optimal classification accuracy.

#### Key Features

- **Accurate Classification**: Achieved notable accuracy in distinguishing between the celebrities using the **SVM** model.
- **Model Export**: The trained model is exported for further deployment using `pickle`.
