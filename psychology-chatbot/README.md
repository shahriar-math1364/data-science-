## **üß† Overview**  
This **Psychology Chatbot** is an AI-powered assistant designed to answer questions related to **happiness, personal growth, depression, social skills, motivation, emotional intelligence, and mental well-being**.  

Unlike generic AI chatbots, this system combines **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Generative AI** to ensure that responses are **fact-based and contextually relevant**. Instead of simply generating free-form responses, the chatbot **retrieves information from psychology textbooks and scientific literature** before leveraging **Generative AI** to formulate an answer.  

It serves as an **educational tool** for students, educators, and mental health enthusiasts, offering **clear, research-backed responses** to psychology-related queries.
