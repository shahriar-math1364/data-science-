## Data
Provide details about the dataset you used, including the source, size, and a brief description of its features.

## Installation
List the necessary libraries and dependencies for running your project. You can include code snippets for installation.

## Usage

To utilize the project, follow these steps:

Clone the project repository from GitHub.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to build and train the regression model.
Input relevant data and obtain price predictions.
Make use of the model for accurate used car price estimation.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial initial step in this project, including:

Dropping unnecessary features, such as 'id,' 'url,' 'image_url,' and more.
Handling missing values, including removing columns with all missing values.
Removing outliers based on price, year, and odometer.
Feature engineering to create a new column named 'size-c' and standardize features like 'year' and 'cylinders.'
One-hot encoding for categorical variables to convert them into numerical values.
