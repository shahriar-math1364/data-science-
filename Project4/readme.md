## Project Overview
This project focuses on the automated classification of tomato plants affected by various diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The aim is to create a robust model capable of accurately identifying and categorizing diseases in tomato plants, which can be invaluable for early disease detection in agriculture.
