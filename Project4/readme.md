![tomato disease](https://github.com/shahriar-math1364/data-science-/blob/main/Project4/tomato%20disease.jpg)

## Project Overview

In the realm of agriculture, tomatoes are a cornerstone crop, integral to the food supply chain worldwide. Their cultivation, however, is often compromised by a spectrum of plant diseases that can adversely affect both yield and quality. Timely and accurate identification of these diseases is critical to take preventive actions that ensure the robust growth and health of the crops.

Our project harnesses the capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a powerful branch of machine learning algorithms, to address the challenge of classifying tomato plant diseases. At the heart of our solution is a comprehensive dataset acquired from Kaggle, which contains high-resolution images representing a range of tomato leaf conditions.

The dataset, contributed by Kaustubh on Kaggle, encompasses multiple categories of diseases including Bacterial Spot, Early Blight, Late Blight, Leaf Mold, Septoria Leaf Spot, Two-spotted Spider Mite, Target Spot, Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus, Tomato Mosaic Virus, as well as healthy leaf specimens. With this data, our CNN model is trained to recognize and classify these disease signatures with precision, enabling rapid and reliable disease diagnosis.

This initiative aims to provide agricultural professionals and farmers with a cutting-edge tool to detect plant diseases early on. By integrating our model with existing agricultural management systems, we aspire to enhance decision-making processes and contribute to more sustainable and productive farming practices.

The use of the Kaggle dataset not only empowers our model with a wide array of training samples but also promotes the replication and iterative improvement of our approach by the broader scientific community.

### Key Objectives

- **Automated Disease Identification:** The primary objective of this project is to automate the process of disease identification in tomato plants. Instead of manual inspection, which can be time-consuming and error-prone, the model can swiftly and accurately analyze images to determine the presence and type of disease.

- **Early Detection:** Early detection of diseases is crucial for effective disease management. By spotting diseases in their early stages, farmers can take immediate actions such as targeted treatments or isolation of affected plants, reducing the spread of diseases and minimizing crop damage.

- **Increased Yield:** Healthy tomato plants produce higher yields. By addressing diseases promptly and accurately, this project contributes to maintaining the health of tomato crops and maximizing their productivity.

### Methodology

The project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning model highly effective in image classification tasks. The CNN model is trained on a dataset of tomato leaf images, each labeled with the corresponding disease type. During training, the model learns to identify distinct patterns and features associated with different diseases.

### Data Collection and Augmentation

The dataset used in this project consists of tomato leaf images, encompassing various disease conditions. Data augmentation techniques, such as random flips and rotations, are applied to diversify the dataset and improve the model's generalization capability.

### Model Training

The CNN model is constructed with multiple convolutional and pooling layers, enabling it to extract hierarchical features from input images. The model's architecture is designed to learn and represent complex relationships within the data. After architecture design, the model is trained on the augmented dataset to optimize its parameters.

### Classification and Prediction

Once trained, the model is capable of classifying new, unseen tomato leaf images. It provides predictions indicating the type of disease present in the image, along with a confidence score.

### Practical Applications

The trained model can be utilized in real-world scenarios by farmers, agricultural experts, and researchers. It offers a convenient tool for disease diagnosis in tomato plants, aiding in timely interventions and enhancing agricultural practices. By integrating this technology into farming processes, stakeholders can make informed decisions to protect their tomato crops.

In summary, this project represents an innovative application of deep learning and image classification techniques to address a significant challenge in agriculture â€“ tomato disease identification. The automated and accurate nature of the model facilitates early disease detection, ultimately contributing to increased tomato yields and sustainable farming practices.

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Loading & Visualization**: Data is directly loaded from the directory structure using TensorFlow's `image_dataset_from_directory`.
2. **Splitting**: Data is methodically split into training (80%), validation (10%), and test sets (10%).
3. **Augmentation**: To enhance model robustness, we applied horizontal and vertical flipping, and random rotation.
4. **Normalization**: All images are resized to 256x256 pixels and pixel values are rescaled to range [0,1].

## Model Building

The model architecture designed for this task is a multi-layered Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Here's a breakdown of its components and the reasoning behind each choice:

### **Input Preprocessing Layers:**
- **Resizing and Rescaling Layer**: 
  - **Purpose**: Ensure all images have consistent dimensions and normalized values.
  - **Details**: Images are resized to a uniform 256x256 pixels and rescaled to have pixel values between [0,1]. This step ensures consistency in input data and aids in faster convergence during training.

### **Convolutional Layers:**
- **Purpose**: These layers learn spatial hierarchies of features.
  - **Configuration**: 
    - Total of five convolutional layers.
    - Each has a kernel size of 3x3.
    - Activation function: 'ReLU'.
    - Using multiple convolutional layers allows the model to learn intricate features and patterns. The ReLU activation helps counter the vanishing gradient problem and introduces non-linearity.

### **Pooling Layers:**
- **Purpose**: Reduction of spatial dimensions of feature maps, enabling fewer parameters and computational savings without significant feature loss.
  - **Configuration**: 
    - Max-pooling is used post each convolutional layer.
    - Pooling window size: 2x2.
    - Max-pooling ensures dominant spatial features are retained.

### **Flattening:**
- **Purpose**: Transitioning from 2D feature maps to 1D vector for dense layers.
  - The 2D feature map obtained post the final pooling step is converted to a 1D vector.

### **Dense (Fully Connected) Layers:**
- **Purpose**: Decision-making based on learned features from preceding layers.
  - **Configuration**: 
    - Initial dense layer: 64 units with 'ReLU' activation.
    - Output layer: 10 units (corresponding to 10 tomato classes) with 'Softmax' activation.
    - Softmax activation gives a probability distribution over classes, apt for multi-class classification.

### **Model Compilation:**
- **Optimizer**: Adam, known for its adaptive learning rate, potentially speeding up convergence.
- **Loss Function**: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy - ideal for multi-class, mutually exclusive classification.

### **Rationale:**
CNNs have excelled in image classification due to their ability to discern hierarchical spatial features in images. Starting from basic edge detectors, they proceed to understand advanced patterns. Our architecture, infused with multiple layers, aims to extract a diverse set of features from the tomato images, enhancing classification accuracy.
